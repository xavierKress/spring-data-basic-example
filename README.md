# spring-data-basic-example
this is a basic example project to show how spring data works

In this project, we will setup a basic domain class and add a repository using spring data. We will then explore what provides the different interfaces we can implement.

After exploring the different interfaces, we will study how to setup JPA entities

01 - Create a basic repository without extending any repository to show that it fails
02 - Extend the repository interface by a basic Spring Data repository
03 - Create a method with a native query
04 - Extend this interface by a CRUD interface
05 - Extend this interface by a Paging And Sorting repository interface
